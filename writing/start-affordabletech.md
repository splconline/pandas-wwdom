# Before You Write the First Draft

## Goal
Why are you writing this?
* To disseminate my ideas on affordable tech, in particular Huawei B315 and Linux
* So that people with less money can have access to the internet
* To increase my clout with the digital inclusion community

## Reframe
Reframe to relate to reader. Why should they care? What is the take away? What is the value added? ("So what?")
* Why they should care: disadvantaged can have access to computers and internet, and be digitally included

## Gather
Data and examples. Authoratative sources + personal sources.
Personal sources: Marie Ward

## Write to One
Who is the target persona? Write to him/her, and only him/her.
