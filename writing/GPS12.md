# 12 Step Writing GPS

## Goal
Why are you writing this?

## Reframe
Reframe to relate to reader. Why should they care? What is the take away? What is the value added? ("So what?")

## Gather
Data and examples. Authoratative sources + personal sources.

## Organize
What format? Blog, Social Media post, Infographic, Case study.

## Write to One
Who is that target persona? Write directly to him/her.

## Draft
Write The Ugly First Draft as if no one will ever read it, show up and throw up.

## Walk Away

## Rewrite
Shape the mess into something your readers wants to read. Swap places with your reader as you write.

## Compose Title
Respect the headline: Spend as much time on it as on the piece itself.

## Edit
Ideally someone with a tight grip on grammar, usage, style and punctuation.

## Check Readability
Is it alluring, inviting, easy to scan? Short paragraphs and bold subheads?

## Publish
... but not before answering the reader's question: "What now?".
