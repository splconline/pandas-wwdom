# Before You Write the First Draft

## Goal
Why are you writing this?

## Reframe
Reframe to relate to reader. Why should they care? What is the take away? What is the value added? ("So what?")

## Gather
Data and examples. Authoratative sources + persoanal sources.

## Organize
What format? Listicle, How-to...

## Write to One
Who is the target persona? Write to him/her, and only him/her.
