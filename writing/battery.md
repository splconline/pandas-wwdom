My venerable workhorse still chuggs along nicely at South Perth Learning Centre, a 2017 MacBook Air that I inherited from the previous coordinator. I saw no reason to replace it when the work computers got replaced, I am a big believer in reducing unnecessary e-waste, and I was attached to the way the operating system works (back when Mac OS X first came out, I was also a latecomer, sticking to Mac OS9 right up until 2006, that's kind of like people who use Windows 7 now).

One problem with this computer though: the battery is dead. It only holds about 10 minutes of charge, which means that 10 minutes from 100% charge, it it will turn off on its own. I leave it plugged in at my office most of the time, so this is not such a big problem. But the lack of battery performance does make it inconvenient when I need to bring the laptop to a different room e.g. to pay supplier bills that need to be co-signed or run a Zoom meeting.

In today's throwaway society, you can't exactly walk into Jaycar, find a MacBook Air 2017 battery and snap it in place. Looking at the MacBook Air, there are no obvious places where the battery is to be snapped in/out, in fact there aren't even any flathead/Phillips head screws to unscrew. But after a bit of Googling I found where to buy a replacement battery, the required tools and instructions on how to do it.

## The Battery And Tools

I purchased the battery and tools from iFixit. It arrived in a long box with a communistic people-power logo, alluding to the masses fighting the big tech corporations for the right to repair. Very nice.

The battery (there were warnings not to touch the soft bits):

The tools were a ... and a . I did do some research before buying these tools as a package with the battery whether or not I could just pick it up at Bunnings. No, I could not. I guess I could of made the spudger out of some household item, but for the price, I might as well order the whole lot as one package.

## Step By Step
I followed the steps in [this video](). Nice to see some diversity in tech, I expected some nerdy dweeb with thick glasses.

## Afterthoughts
So there you have it, definitely not as straightforward as replacing the battery laptops of old, where you walk into the computer store, buy the battery and just snap it in. But not impossible as I hope you gathered from this article. I hope you take up this challenge one day when your laptop battery dies!
