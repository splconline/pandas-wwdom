As a digital literacy coordinator (read: I help seniors with their mobile phones), I have my ear close to the ground when it comes to issues affecting the 60+ demographic when it comes to technology. Recently, with rising inflation abound, the issue of mobile phone bills has been coming up frequently.

Telstra just raised their prices, and several have approached me at the Centre wanting to look at their options. Reading the news, their not the only ones. There are many of us who default to the big two when it comes to mobile phones, Telstra and Optus. The big two of course know this, which is why we are at the mercy of their prices. With rising inflation and price increases, we are feeling the pinch even more. Which is presumably why the topic of moving away from Telstra/Optus is coming up more often.

A big roadblock however is that many of this demographic have ended up with locked phones. You're not that concerned with the bells and whistles, you just want a basic phone for calls and SMS, maybe a bit of YouTube watching, so you pick up a cheap phone at Woolies, Coles or the Post Office. By virtue of the targeting, these supermarket phones are mostly locked prepaid phones. The handsets come with a prepaid SIM (how very convenient) are locked to Telstra, Optus or Vodaphone.

This is not an issue, it was the most convenient way for you to get a phone, until call prices go up. Looking around, you realise that the two dominant players in the industry have the highest prices, but the handset you bought is tied to them.

So what happens when you put another SIM (which cheaper call rates) in a locked phone?

This is what happens:

But there is a way around it: if your locked phone is over 2 years old, it is possible to (legally) unlock the locked phone, and I will now describe the process for Telstra locked phones (I might do separate articles for Optus/Vodafone).

## Before You Start

At a glance the process is quite simple, it involves a single phone call to Telstra, after which they will email you a numeric code, and that's the number you need to enter at the photo above, unlocking your phone. Easy! However, the devil is in the detail. Before you make this phone call to Telstra, there are two items they will ask for, which you need to prepare:

### A Telstra Account
They will need to identify you in their system, even if you are not the previous owner of the phone to be unlocked. So get ready with your Telstra account number, which will be on any bill/notification that you receive from Telstra. If you are an ex-Telstra user (you don't have a current Telstra service), they can still find you using your email address (if you receive your notifications on your email). Because of this, it is easiest to unlock your phone *before* you move to a different provider.

### Your Locked Phone's IMEI Number
Every mobile phone has an IMEI number, you can either look for it on the phone itself under the battery, on the original packaging (if you kept it), or by typing 2243 on the phone. In your upcoming phone call with Telstra, they will ask for this number to identify your locked phone. Also note down the model, the will ask for that as well (I'm not sure if it is required for the unlocking process, but if anything, it makes you sound authoritative).

## Let's Do It
Now that you have prepared both your Telstra Account and your locked phone's IMEI number, it's time to get going.

Dial 13134134, and wait for the automated voice to ask you to say your issue. Say very clearly: "phone unlocking". They will suggest that you download the Telstra app, ignore this suggestion, and respond accordingly by pressing the appropriate button.

If everything goes well, you will be put on hold, and reach an actual person. Please note that this call centre person will be likely unfamiliar with the phone unlocking procedure, because it is not something often asked for. So be patient with them while they look things up. But be firm that you have read that your phone is eligible for unlocking because you have owned it for over 2 years.

Eventually, they will ask you for your Telstra account details and the IMEI number of the phone. They will also give you a reference number, make sure you write this down in case you need to call again when things don't work out so smoothly.

The call centre person cannot immediately give you the unlocking code, this will be emailed to you within 5 days. So now it is time to...

## Sit Back and Wait
Yes, wait for that email to arrive. When it does, it will look something like this:

So now we're on to the final step.

## Unlock Your Phone
Put a non-Telstra SIM card in your phone (if you don't already have one, borrow one from a friend) and switch it on. As before, you will be prompted to enter a code.

Now that you have a code from the Telstra email, enter those digits.

Voila, have now unlocked your Telstra phone! You can now use it with any provider. Which provider should you choose? That's for another article.

I hope this guide helped you to successfully unlock your Telstra phone, do write in the comments if you have any questions, comments or further suggestions.
