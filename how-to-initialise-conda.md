# How to Initialise Conda

## 1. Download

We will use the 'mini' version available [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (scroll down to 'Linux Installers').

As of writing 20.02.2022, the latest miniconda file was `Miniconda3-py39_4.11.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`

## 2. Install

To install, navigate to the folder containing the above and then 'bash' it:

```
bash Miniconda3-py39_4.11.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Note that this command was current at 20.02.2022, don't copy-paste it!

(Hint: use tab predictive text to select the file, saves you typing out the whole filename)

## 3. Create Environment

A 'base' environment will be created. To see what environment you are in:



Create a separate environment to the base environment (leave the base environment clean, no sure why, the video said so), then activate it.

If you like, check the current environment as before.

## 4. Add Packages

Add the required packages:
